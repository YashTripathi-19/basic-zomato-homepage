# 🍽 Zomato Clone - Basic Frontend Project

This is a simple front-end clone of Zomato’s homepage designed using HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript. It was built as my **first project in web development** to explore the basics of layout design, styling, and UI structure.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- Fully static front-end (no backend).
- Clean layout inspired by Zomato's homepage.
- Responsive design for different screen sizes.
- Basic animations and hover effects.
- Simple footer layout with sections and app download buttons.

## 📁 Folder Structure

/img → All images used in the website (logo, icons, etc.)
/css → Contains the main stylesheet (style.css)
/js → Basic frontend interaction scripts (script.js)
index.html → The main page of the website


## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YashTripathi-19/basic-zomato-homepage.git
2. Navigate into the folder:
   cd zomato-clone-basic
3. Open index.html in your browser.

✅ That’s it! No dependencies or build tools required.
